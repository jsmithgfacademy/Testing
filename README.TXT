This is a project about learning to use GitHub 
Classroom and practicing using classes.

Directions
1.  Examine the Cat class, don't worry about syntax,
just identify the constructor and method.  No changes
are made to this file.

2.  Complete the CatTalk main method as shown
in its comment.  Using class Cat is very similar
to using JButton, or GTurtle, but you are able
to see the insides of the class, not just the API.

3.  When done editing CatTalk, click Status -- you
will see that files have been modified.

4.  Click commit/push, type an appropriate comment
then wait for the upload to GitHub Classroom to complete.

5.  Check on GitHub you will see your changes are
recorded -- it is like a backup and a submission of
your work.
